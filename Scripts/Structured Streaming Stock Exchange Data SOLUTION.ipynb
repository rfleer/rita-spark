In order to achieve this, the Structured Streaming consumer (running in this notebook) will read financial data from a socket stream (make sure to start the Producer first in order to have this data available), compute a few aggregations on the stream and compare the new results with the historical values.\n\nAs a first step, we must parse the strings read from the socket stream, in order to be able to further on process the incoming data in a structured format. This parsing is already provided to you in the code block below.

Aggregations\n\nOnce we have generated a windowed computation on the raw stream, we need to also define the aggregations that we want to perform on the data.
