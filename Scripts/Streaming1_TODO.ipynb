Afterwards you perform the following three exercises:\n- Part I: Print the stream\n- Part II: Count the number of words in each stream\n- Part III: Mask swear words, i.e. replace all swear words in the stream (based on a list of specficialy provided swear words) with asterixes (\"*\").\n\nTo start Spark Streaming you have to open a stream.\nYou can do this with the netcat notebook - look there for more information.\n\nAfter you start the stream you can call the `main(timeout, func, window)`function.<br>\n\n## main explanation\n### timeout:\nIn this environment you normally won't see an output of Spark Streaming after the Streaming is terminated.\nTo let this happen, we define a time in seconds when the streaming will terminate to see it's output. In a \"normal\" environment you won't need a timeout time. For instance, if the timeout is set to 10 seconds, you will see a streaming output of 10 seconds and then the stream terminates.\n\n### func\nThis parameter has to be a function which will take the stream as a parameter.\nWhen you solve an exercise, you have to program it in a function which takes the stream as parameter.\nSo it's easy to solve different exercises without jumping in the code.\n\n### window\nThe window is a parameter for Spark.\nIt defines the interval the data is processed.\nExample: \n- window = 1 ==> Every 1 second a new data stream is processed\n- window = 5 ==> Every 5 seconds a new data stream is processed\n\n## When problems occurs\nWhen something went wrong, you can restart the cluster.</br>\nWhen you restart it, you have to execute every piece of code again (especially the main block)<br>"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"3e181e20-ee93-4fcb-81fd-74c9aa6783cd","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Run the code for the function `main`\n=> Click on it and press `Shift` + `<ENTER>`"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"70414f67-65d8-436e-bfd3-7a63360e88fc","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from pyspark import SparkContext, SparkConf\nfrom pyspark.streaming import StreamingContext\n\ndef main(timeout, func, window):\n    # Create a local StreamingContext and SparkContext.\n    # In the databricks environment a default SparkContext already exists, so we can't create a second one.\n    #sc = SparkContext(\"local[*]\", \"Streaming-Exercise\")  # `*` means running Spark locally with as many worker threads as logical cores on your machine, otherwise you can specify any arbitrary number of threads instead\n    ssc = StreamingContext(sc, window)\n    stream = ssc.socketTextStream(\"localhost\", 9999)\n\n    func(stream)\n    try:\n        ssc.start() # Start the computation\n        ssc.awaitTerminationOrTimeout(timeout)  # To see the output in Python, we have to wait until it's finished.\n    finally:\n        ssc.stop(False)"],"metadata":{"application/vnd.databricks.v1+cell":{"showTitle":false,"cellMetadata":{},"nuid":"6a412d69-f048-4c91-84eb-0584e0e6d5b1","inputWidgets":{},"title":""}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":0},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Part One\nFirst print the stream -
